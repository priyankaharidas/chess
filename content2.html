<b>It First started in INDIA
</b><br />
<div>
In the 6th century A.D., when the Gupta Empire ruled in India, a game called Chaturaṅga was fast gaining popularity
Chaturaṅga, translates as "four divisions (of the military)": infantry, cavalry, elephantry, and chariotry, represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively
</div>
<br />
<b>Why Chaturaṅga was similar to Chess</b>
<div>The four divisions in Chaturaṅga (infantry, cavalry, elephantry and chariotry) are found in modern Chess
Chaturaṅga was also played on a 8 x 8 board
Both games are played with different pieces having different powers
Victory depended on the fate of one piece, just like the king in modern chess</div>
<br />
<b>How Chaturaṅga changed to Chess</b>

<div>When the game spread to Persia in the 7th century A.D., it began to be called Chatrang which changed with time to Shatranj
The term Shah Maat to describe what is now known as Check mate also evolved at that time and it is the word 'Shah' meaning King, which is gradually believed to have evolved into the word 'Chess</div>
<br />
<b>Other theories for Origin of Chess</b>
<div>Many people claim that Chess was first invented in their country including Russians, Chinese, Turks and Greeks
However most scholars now agree that India gave birth to Chess through Chaturaṅga
The theories regarding the origin of Chess has given rise to many interesting though untrue tales. Now we will take a look at two such stories</div>
<br />

<div>
<b> Ravana's Queen Mandodari</b>
In the great epic Ramayana, the demon king Ravana invents chess to amuse his wife Mandodari.
A brilliant mind, she promptly beats him at it.
Some other versions credit Mandodari for inventing the game herself while Ravana was busy fighting wars</div>
<br />
<b>The story of Talhand and Gav</b>
<br />
<div>This story appears in Persian poet Ferdowsi's Shah-nama written in the 11th century.
Talhand and Gav, two half-brothers battle for the throne of Hind (India). They meet in battle and Talhand dies on his elephant without a wound.
Their mother is sad that Gav killed his brother but Gav tells her that he did not kill Talhand
To convince her the sages of the court invent the game of chess, detailing the pieces and how they move, to show the mother of the princes how the battle unfolded and how Talhand died of fatigue when surrounded by his enemies.</div>
<br />
<b>Chess has come a long way</b>
<div>
The game has spread all over the world in the last fifteen hundred years
Despite being the country of origin, India had to wait a long time before we produced an official World Champion of the game – Vishwanathan Anand in 2000.
In the next lesson on Chess History, we will look at how the game spread outside India
